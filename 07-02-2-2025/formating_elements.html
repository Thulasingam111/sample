    <strong>Nature</strong> is an inherent character or constitution,<a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
    particularly of the <a href="#">ecosphere</a> or the <a href=""#>universe</a> as a whole. 
    In this general sense nature refers to the <a href="#">laws</a>, elements and <a href="#">phenomena</a> 
    of the physical world, including <a href="#">life</a>. Although humans are part of nature,
    human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, 
    or outright <a href="#">separate and even superior</a> to <nature class="a"><sup>[2]</sup></nature>
